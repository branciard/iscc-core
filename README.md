# ISCC - Reference Implementation of Core Algorithms

The **International Standard Content Code** is a proposal for an 
[open standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_standard) for decentralized content 
identification. This repository contains a lightweight reference implementation of the 
core  algorithms for the proposed **ISCC Standard** in Python3.
